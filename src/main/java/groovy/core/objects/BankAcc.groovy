 *  We can use @TupleConstructor for example in those occasions when we have to many fields. So when we use this annotation we can
 *  initialize our fields in order that they are declared in that way:
 *  BankAcc bankAcc = new BankAcc("â‚´", "34 892", "#3929388493", "email@email.net", "pass")

class BankAcc {
    String currency

    String accountNumber
    String emailToBanking
    String password
